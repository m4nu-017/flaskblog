# flaskblog
This was my first project in flaskblog which i had done in sept 2023. A basic blogpost website which can store user data and a web portal with login capabilities.
As a beginner i enjoyed my time learning backend development and got hands on experience on how to build backend part of a website,having prior knowledge of HTML , Tailwind CSS and CSS helped me make a decent frontend page as well,As curious developer i am still exploring various fields of this vast space but this blogpost page was the Start for this amazing exploration journey and im loving it.
